  - Create a new Django project and app.
  - Define the model for the website, including fields for the URL, status, and any other relevant information.
  - Create a form for adding and editing websites.
  - Create a view and template for displaying a list of all the websites being monitored.
  - Create a view and template for adding a new website.
  - Create a view and template for editing an existing website.
  - Write a script that will send a request to each website at regular intervals
  -  (e.g. every 5 minutes) to check if it is up or down.
  -  To use the requests library to send HTTP requests.
  - Store the results of the uptime checks in the database.
  - Create an API endpoint for retrieving historical stats for up and down times. To use Django Rest Framework to create the API.
    - Set up email and/or SMS notifications using Django's built-in email and messaging libraries. To use a service 
  	like Twilio to send SMS messages.
	- (Optional) Set up a background task using a task queue like Celery to run the uptime checks and send notifications asynchronously.
	That should give you a basic SaaS for monitoring website uptime and downtime, as well as providing an API 
	and notification system. To then customize and extend it further to meet your specific needs.
